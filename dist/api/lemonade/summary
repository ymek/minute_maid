Simply maintains significant image advantages as \"best tasting,\" \"purest\" and \"most authentic.\"<br/><br/><strong>Minute Maid</strong> got help early from launch and advertising of Drops and remains the most spontaneously mentioned Lemonade brand. But, the brand slumps toward the last few months of '14, falling behind Simply as #1 Favorite."
