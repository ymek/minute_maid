  "summary": "<strong>Minute Maid</strong> has an awareness edge in Juice Drinks and is respected for its \"high quality,\" \"good value\" and as a \"brand the whole family enjoys.\"<br/><br/><strong>Simply</strong> may not have as much awareness in this category, but the brand's well-earned OJ tradition for \"purity\" and \"authenticity\" is reflected among those aware of the brand.  This represents a good jumping off point as Juice Drink advertising gets underway and with no one brand dominating as #1 Favorite.<br/><br/>Ghost levels for metrics prior to the Simply Juice Drinks launch in Dec '14 constitute a significant portion of current levels being shown. Caution should be used until we get additional months of data to understand how metrics are trending."
